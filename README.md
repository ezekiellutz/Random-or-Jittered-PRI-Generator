# Random-or-Jittered-PRI-Generator

A simple python script that generates a random or jittered Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI) for an emitter. This script will generate both a random and jittered PRI for a given PRI range that is entered. Nominal values are entered in the code for testing purposes but can easily by changed to user desired values. The script also exports the random and jittered PRI values to an .xlsx file that can easily be used for other applications.
